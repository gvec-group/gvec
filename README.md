## GVEC 

### Overview

GVEC (Galerkin Variational Equilibrium Code) is an open-source software for
the generation of three-dimensional ideal MHD equilibria.
The ideas are strongly based on on the VMEC code, 
see [VMEC wiki pages](http://vmecwiki.pppl.wikispaces.net/VMEC).
Also a VMEC generated netcdf outputfile can be used for initialization of GVEC.

GVEC reuses parts of the open-source code [HOPR](https://github.com/fhindenlang/hopr).

GVEC has been developed in the department of **Numerical Methods in Plasma Physics (NMPP)**
lead by Prof. Eric Sonnendruecker at the Max-Planck Institute for Plasma Physics 
in Garching, Germany.
