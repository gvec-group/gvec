# Developer Guide

These pages contain development guidelines and useful resources for developing GVEC.

## Contact

GVEC is mainly being developed in the department of **Numerical Methods in Plasma Physics (NMPP)**
led by Prof. Eric Sonnendruecker at the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics 
in Garching, Germany. Outside contributions are of course very welcome!

## Object-Oriented Programming in FORTRAN

Here is a recommendation for a tutorial on how to program in an object-oriented way
with [polymorphism in fortran](https://gist.github.com/n-s-k/522f2669979ed6d0582b8e80cf6c95fd).
